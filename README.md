# 3D-portfolio
First experience with Three.js

I followed Andrew Woan's tutorial on Three.js - Creating the portfolio room. Unfortunately he deleted the tutorial not long ago because too many people copied it exactly without crediting him.
For those who want to start the project, they need to clone it and enter in the terminal npm i and npm run dev being in the application directory.
